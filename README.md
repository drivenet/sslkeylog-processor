# sslkeylog-processor
This is a tool to process logs produced by the [sslkeylog](https://github.com/drivenet/sslkeylog) utility and send them to a MongoDB instance.

## Building
`cargo build --release && upx --best target/release/sslkeylog-processor`

[UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx) is used to reduce binary size, if you prefer not using it, just skip it.

If your build system's glibc is different from the target one, you may encounter the following error:
```text
sslkeylog-processor: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_...' not found (required by sslkeylog-processor)
```

To fix this you might want to build a [MUSL](https://musl.libc.org/)-based static binary. Prepare the environment with the following commands:
```shell
sudo apt install musl-tools
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```
Then just use:
`cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl && upx --best target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/sslkeylog-processor`

## Usage
Run the built binary to determine the command-line options.
On Windows, file names support [wildcard expansion](https://docs.rs/glob/), on other OSes shell expansion is expected to take care of that.

## Schema
All keys are placed in the collections named `<sni>@<server_ip>:<server_port>_<year><month><day>` with the following schemas:
```javascript
// TLS pre-1.3
{
  "_id": <server_random>:BinData,
  "t": <timestamp>:DateTime,
  "r": <client_random>:BinData,
  "i": <client_ip>:int/BinData,
  "p": <client_port>:int,
  "c": <cipher_id>:int,
  "k": <premaster>:BinData,
}

// TLS 1.3:
{
  "_id": <server_random>:BinData,
  "t": <timestamp>:DateTime,
  "r": <client_random>:BinData,
  "i": <client_ip>:int/BinData,
  "p": <client_port>:int,
  "c": <cipher_id>:int,
  "h": <server_handshake>:BinData,
  "f": <client_handshake>:BinData,
  "z": <server_0>:BinData,
  "s": <client_0>:BinData,
}
```

Each collection has the following indexes:
1. `random` on the `r` field (ascending)
2. `timestamp` on the `t` field (ascending)
